Please analyze the project for any redeclared identifiers, especially focusing on:
1. Duplicate function declarations like `WebSocketHandler` in the file `websocket_handler.go`.
2. Name collisions within the same package or across imported packages.
3. Structural or organizational issues that may cause redeclaration errors.

Please provide a report listing:
- All conflicting or duplicated declarations
- The corresponding file paths and line numbers
- Suggestions for resolving the conflicts (e.g., renaming, refactoring)
